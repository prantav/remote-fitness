# 1.Overview

In our modern age, many adults are striving to maintain perfect health and fitness yet it goes without saying that to do this they will need a good personal trainer. However often it is hard for them to meet their perfect trainer. We help solve this issue by connecting trainers and trainees via our intuitive app.

Many of us have experienced first-hand what it feels like to go to the gym and work hard following the youtube videos by the so called &quot;gurus&quot;or others misguiding prerecorded video tutorial apps only to get a painful cramp. We know how this feels and believe that it is important to have a good and passionate personal trainer who can help you on your journey to fitness and perfect health.
